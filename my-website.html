			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</div>
		<p>I grew up in a city called San Gabriel, CA, which is also known as the foot massage capital of the country. I currently live in the ironically overcast Sunset district of San Francisco. Both of my parents are architects. I have two older siblings, who are incidentally twins. My brother is a NYC-based graphic designer and my sister is a yoga instructor living in LA. I'm the only blonde in my family. My first name comes from the Latin word for "wisdom," and my last name comes from the English word for "garden." I can only assume that my ancestors were once gardeners. (Not really sure about that one, though.) I'm technically a quarter German, a quarter Polish, a quarter Dutch, an eighth English, and an eighth Scottish, though that really just makes me a mutt.</p>
		<p>Ever since I was five years old, I was hell-bent on becoming a surgeon. I was so convinced that medicine was the path for me that I spent the first two years of my undergraduate career at UC Berkeley trudging through biology, organic chemistry, physics, and the like. After my sophomore year, I finally admitted to myself that I was clinging onto a childhood fantasy that no longer resonated with my interests. At the beginning of my third year, I studied abroad at a small liberal arts honors college in Utrecht, the Netherlands, where I fell in love with sociology. The field perfectly suited my orientation to detail, empathy for others, problem-solving capabilities, and critical mind. Upon returning to Berkeley, I immersed myself in the discipline and enjoyed it so much that I stayed a fifth year to complete an honors thesis. I graduated this past May with highest honors in sociology. Interestingly, the very same qualities that attracted me to the social sciences are what currently fascinate me about programming. Ideally, I envision a future in which the two fields are far more intricately connected. I believe that programming provides the skill-set to actualize projects that can benefit society at large.</p>
		<p>Beyond work and academia, I am a yoga enthusiast who appreciates a strong cup of coffee and an intense game of foosball. I am mildly obsessed with the New York Times crossword puzzle (though when I can't get my hands on one, the LA Times puzzle will suffice). I became interested in food and cooking while living at a student co-operative in college. During the two and a half years that I lived in the house, I spent three hours once a week preparing five different dishes to feed forty people. I also love to visit new places and experience different cultures (and, of course, taste new cuisines).</p>
