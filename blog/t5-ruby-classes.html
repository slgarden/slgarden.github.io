        <p>Although I'm technically only in my third week of learning to code in Ruby, I can already tell that it is a very versatile language. Two weeks ago I covered two important data structures in ruby, arrays and hashes. Arrays and hashes are similar to classes in that they all are containers that store objects in specific ways according to different sets of rules. However, there are distinct differences between the two. While arrays and hashes are useful for modeling data, classes are useful for representing or grouping data in a particular way. Classes, in essence, are collections of data and methods that can perform actions on that data. In other words, classes provide both the state (what something is) and behavior (what something does) for new objects.</p>
        <p>That was a lot of conceptual babble, so let's get to know Ruby classes a little better with a concrete example. As mentioned above, classes are helpful when you want to create a template for a group of similar objects. Let's say we want to create a class of different cities. We begin by calling the class method:<pre class="prettyprint">class City<br/>end</pre>Note the class must close with the end keyword. The first thing to do with our City class is to initialize some variables within it (this is like setting a given City object's properties). To do this, we must create a method within our City class:<pre class="prettyprint">class City<br/>def initialize (name, state, population)<br/>@name = name<br/>@state = state<br/>@population = population<br/>end<br/>end</pre>Here, we have created three instance variables using the @ symbol. These are variables that belong to an instance of the class City. We can create a few instances of City with the appropriate variables as follows:<pre class="prettyprint">san_francisco = City.new("San Francisco", "CA", 837,442)<br/>new_york = City.new("New York", "NY", 8,405,837)<br/>los_angeles = City.new("Los Angeles", "CA", 3,884,307)<br/>chicago = City.new("Chicago", "IL", 2,718,782)</pre>As you can see from the above instances of our City class, the best city isn't necessarily the one with the most people! In all seriousness, what we've created here are four instances of our City class, san_francisco, new_york, los_angeles, and chicago. Each of these objects holds information about that particular city.</p>
        <p>We can also modify our class such that it gives each instance some sort of behavior. This is accomplished through instance methods. For example, if we want to print out the information stored in a particular instance of the City class, we could write:<pre class="prettyprint">class City<br/>def initialize (name, state, population)<br/>@name = name<br/>@state = state<br/>@population = population<br/>end<br/>def print_info<br/>p "#{@name}, #{@state} contains #{@population} people."<br/>end<br/>end</pre>This code prints the following when called upon:<pre class="prettyprint">san_francisco.print_info <br/># => "San Francisco, CA contains 837,442 people."</pre></p>
        <p>Classes have a ton of cool functionality (like inheritance, which allows child classes to inherit methods and variables from their parent classes), but this post is simply meant to teach the basics. We've defined our very own City class, created four instances of it, and stored information in each of those City objects. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
