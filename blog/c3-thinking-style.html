        <h2>Gregorc Thinking & VARK Learning Styles</h2>

        <p>Before beginning Phase 0 of DevBootcamp, I was instructed to take a few personality assessments to determine my thinking and learning styles. According to the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, I am an Abstract Sequential thinker, and the <a href="http://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/">VARK Learning Style</a> claims I am a multimodal learner. (You can also take the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc</a> and <a href="http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">VARK</a> tests!) This all sounds like a ton of psychobabble, so I'll break it down further.</p>
        <p>The following is a snapshot of my thinking style according to the Gregorc method: <br/><br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TYBGYC5.png"/><br/><br/>When I first took this test prior to DBC, I was a bit skeptical about my classification as an Abstract Sequential thinker. However, after going through the first three weeks of DevBootcamp, I've got to admit that this test perfectly sums up how I think and learn. The summary mentions that AS learners struggle with not having enough time to fully understand a given concept. Thus far, this has been very true for me. Although I do feel as though I am learning A TON in Phase 0, I find myself constantly worrying about not having enough time to solidify all of the new information. I believe this will be my greatest struggle throughout the program, but I also believe it can be managed. One way to mitigate this issue is to spread out new material over the course of the entire week, taking small breaks in between. This will allow the information to sink in, so-to-speak. In addition, I am going to start reading a little bit of David A. Black's "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" every morning to kickstart my workflow.</p>
        <p>My VARK 'multimodal' learning style illustrates that I learn best through a combination of methods. I think this has helped me thus far in DBC because the program offers multiple ways of obtaining information. My optimal learning process is as follows: explore new information or material on my own first, then process the information in greater detail in a lecture or written format, and finally work through problems or apply the material to a tangible product. Interestingly enough, my learning style is directly related to my thinking style in that I like to explore multiple resources in order to fully understand a given concept. Right now I feel as though I'm lacking interpersonal work and lecture-style learning environments, but this will change once the on-site portion of the program begins. I am not at all afraid of asking questions and communicating my thoughts, and I often find that this helps me solidify complicated subject matter. I look forward to doing this in a more social environment.</p>
        <p>While it is important to know your thinking and learning styles, I believe it's more crucial to understand that they have the ability to change. Psychologist Carol Dweck elaborates upon this idea with her concepts of fixed and growth mindsets. According to Dweck, a fixed mindset assumes that an individual's intelligence is established at a young age and is static from that point onward. This ultimately leads to a constant desire to prove oneself and the simultaneous fear of failure. On the contrary, a growth mindset is a state of mind in which one believes that intelligence can be developed. This line of thinking allows for continual achievement by enabling an individual to embrace challenges and learn from failures. I think one clear way I can improve my thinking and learning styles is to adhere to a more regimented, organized way of learning. In order to be the most successful learner I can be, I need to create a schedule that I can stick to each week. Now, this schedule doesn't have to be completely rigid, but it should act as a guide to make sure I am accessing the most resources possible in a given week.</p>
        <p>Learning a bit more about my thinking and learning style has helped me understand why I may be feeling "behind" in my DBC work thus far. The most important thing to remember, though, is that nothing is permanent! </p>
