        <p>Last week marked the beginning of the trial of Ross Ulbricht, who is accused of creating and maintaining the infamous online drug market the Silk Road. Given this, I figured it would be a good idea to research a little thing that made this black market possible in the first place: Bitcoin.</p>
        <p>I've known about Bitcoin for a few years now, but my knowledge goes no further than the understanding that it is an online currency exchange. With its importance in global news recently, I felt it was high time to finally learn exactly how the process works. </p>
        <p>Perhaps the first and most important distinction between Bitcoin and other forms of currency exchanges is that it is a decentralized peer-to-peer market. In other words, there is no central bank or third party overseeing all of the transactions occuring in the exchange. Rather, it keeps track of the flow of money via a <em>blockchain</em>, which is a digital transaction record of every individual Bitcoin. For instance, imagine a $1 bill in your wallet. A blockchain is similar to having an entire list of people who have had that $1 since it's fabrication. Contrary to popular opinion, this actually makes Bitcoin quite traceable (though still anonymous).</p>
        <p>Another key distinction between Bitcoin and other forms of currency is that blockchains are visible to everyone. That is, every transaction that occurs in the marketplace is public. This is important because without a third party governing and regulating the flow of money, this is the way Bitcoin makes sure no one is scamming the system and trying to trade more than they currently have. As mentioned above, Bitcoin tracks all transactions via the blockchain, which operates as a ledger. Rather than restricting access to this transaction ledger to parties immediately involved in the transaction, Bitcoin allows these ledgers to be viewable to everyone. Finally, the code is completely open source, which allows intelligent individuals to make sure everything is operating fairly and improve what needs fixing.</p>
        <p>This is a far cry from an in-depth look at Bitcoin, but at the very least it gives a glimpse of how the market works.</p>
