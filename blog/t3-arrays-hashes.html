        <h1>[Arrays] & {Hashes}</h1>
        <h2>Subtle, yet <em>key</em> differences</h2>

        <p>There are several ways to represent collections of items in Ruby, and two of the most common of these representations are arrays and hashes. Array and Hash are classes that share similar characteristics, though also have explicit differences that allow them to serve different purposes. Since Ruby is an object-oriented language, the contents inside arrays and hashes are objects. Arrays can consist of any type of object, and a single array does not need to have the same type of object. An array can even consist of arrays! The following are examples of arrays: <br/><br/>numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]<br/>cheeses = ['camembert', 'gouda', 'brie']<br/>enlightened = [['meaning', 'of', 'life'], 42, true]<br/><br/>Another important feature of arrays is that they keep track of the order of each element through the index. The first element in the array has the index 0, the second element has the index 1, and so on. You can access an element at a particular index by simply typing: <br/><br/>cheeses[2] # => 'brie'<br/><br/>To access elements from the end of the array, use negative integers as the index. The last element has an index of -1, the second to last element has an index of -2, and (again) so on. Arrays also have the ability to be iterated over, meaning that you can go through each item (or element) in the array and have it do something. Iterating over an array can be an extremely useful technique when you want to change all or certain elements of the array. The Array class has its own set of methods that can be used, or any method from the Enumerable module may be used on an array. These methods can be found on the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html">Ruby Docs Array</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html">Ruby Docs Enumerable</a>. For example, to multiply each element in the numbers array by the integer 3, you can use the #map method:<br/><br/>numbers.map {|num| num * 3} # => [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]<br/><br/>The above code takes the array numbers and iterates through each element (denoted here as 'num'), multiplying that element (num) by the integer 3.</p>
        <p>Hashes are very similar to arrays, with a few <em>key</em> and <em>value</em>able differences: rather than a collection of single objects, they contain pairs of objects stored as keys and values! Keys and their values come as sets, and every key must be different, but several keys can have the same value. This may be a bit confusing, so the best way to illustrate this is through an example:<br/><br/>coffee_quality = {'Blue Bottle' => 'awesome', 'Stumptown' => 'awesome', 'Starbucks' => 'burnt', '7/11' => 'brown water'}<br/><br/>As you can see, each key is different, but some values are the same (e.g., 'awesome'). Like arrays, you can iterate over hashes and do something to each key/value pair. The following example uses the #each method to print each key/value pair in a statement:<br/><br/>coffee_quality.each {|k,v| puts "#{k} coffee is #{v}"} # => <br/>Blue Bottle coffee is awesome<br/>Stumptown coffee is awesome<br/>Starbucks coffee is burnt<br/>7/11 coffee is brown water<br/><br/>You may notice that iterating over a hash looks very much like iterating over an array, except there are <em>two</em>items in between the | | pipes, which stand for the key (k) and value (v).</p>
        <p>In sum, arrays and hashes are two extremely powerful collection objects in Ruby. When you have a list of ordered objects, an array comes in handy because it maps each element to an integer value (it's index). However, if you have a list of objects that you want to map to something <em>other</em> than an integer, hashes are what you need to use. While there are FAR more ways to use arrays and hashes than what I've outlined above, this is a quick introduction to the two concepts and brief explanation of their similarities and differences.</p>
