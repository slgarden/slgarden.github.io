        <h1>The Dangers of Stereotype Threat</h1>

        <p>I was extremely excited when I discovered that the DBC cultural blog post this week focused on stereotype threat because I studied the concept in several of my sociology and social psychology courses in college. Needless to say, this is right up my alley. For those who have never heard of this concept before, I'll elaborate briefly.</p>
        <p>Stereotype threat is the phenomenon in which people who identify with minority groups tend to perform worse when they are subconsciously reminded of a stereotype attributed to them. The classic experiment, conducted by psychologist Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in 1995, demonstrated that African-American college students performed significantly worse on a verbal section of the GRE than did European-American students when the test was described beforehand as a "diagnostic of intellectual ability." When the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability", African-American students fared far better. Steele and Aronson attribute this difference to negative stereotypes associated with African-Americans and intelligence. When the African-American students read that the test was a mark of intellectual ability, it triggered these negative stereotypes and influenced their performance.</p>
        <p>Psychologists have conducted similar experiments on several other minority groups, and all have corroborated the alarming presence of stereotype threat. One of my favorite studies on the subject was conducted by Johns, Schmader, and Martens in 2005. In this study, men and women were asked to complete a set of math problems and are placed in one of three different conditions. The first is the stereotype threat condition: it describes the task as a "math test." In the second, non-stereotype threat condition it is described as a "problem solving task." In the final condition, the task is described as a "math test" but the participants are also informed of the effects of stereotype threat. Unsurprisingly, on average women performed worse than men in the first condition and equally in the second condition. Interestingly enough, women also performed similarly to men in the final "teaching" condition, even though negative stereotypes about their gender were triggered!</p>
        <p>The above study illustrates just how much power knowledge has on how we perceive ourselves. I believe this has helped me thus far in DBC, especially as a female. It is no great surprise that the tech industry (and basically every STEM field, for that matter) is dominated by men. However, I believe that the reason for this discrepancy has everything to do with socialization and nothing to do with technical or intellectual ability. By continually reminding myself of this fact, I am effectively eliminating the detrimental side-effects of stereotype threat on my performance as a beginning programmer.</p>
