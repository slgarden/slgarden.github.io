        <p>After a brief introduction to Ruby and some of its methods last week, I've begun to dig deeper into the language this week. Specifically, I've focused on looking at the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a> module, which contains a large variety of versatile methods that can be used on many objects, including collections such as arrays and hashes. In this post I'll be <em>hash</em>ing out the method #group_by (which produces hashes! But more on that in a second...).</p>
        <p>#Group_by is powerful method that takes an array as its input and returns a hash. The elements of the array become the values of the hash, and the block specifies what the keys of the hash will be. In layman's terms, this means that a list of objects goes in, and those objects come out grouped together based on a similar characteristic. (You can refer to the Ruby docs explanation of #group_by <a href="In layman's terms, this means that a list of objects goes in, and those objects come out in groups based on a similar characteristic. ">here</a>.) This may sound a bit confusing, so let's elucidate #group_by with an example.</p>
        <p>Let's say you have a list of names.<pre class="prettyprint">names = ["Tyrion Lannister", "Jaime Lannister", "Arya Stark", <br/>"Jon Snow", "Tywin Lannister", "Eddard Stark", <br/>"Robb Stark", "Sansa Stark", "Cersei Lannister", <br/>"Joffrey 'Baratheon' (but we all know he's really a Lannister)", <br/>"Daenerys Targaryen", "Brienne Tarth", "Bran Stark"]</pre>You want to separate the list of names into two groups: Lannisters and everyone else.<pre class="prettyprint">names.group_by {|name| name.include?("Lannister")}<br/># => {true=>["Tyrion Lannister", "Jaime Lannister", "Tywin Lannister", <br/># "Cersei Lannister", "Joffrey 'Baratheon' (but we all know <br/># he's really a Lannister)"], <br/># => false=>["Arya Stark", "Jon Snow", "Eddard Stark", "Robb Stark", <br/># "Sansa Stark", "Daenerys Targaryen", "Brienne Tarth", "Bran Stark"]}</pre>And there you are! Now you have two groups: a group of Lannisters, and a group of everyone else (since the Lannisters only care about their own, and often not even that).<br/><img src="http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.14107130.8187/fc,550x550,white.u1.jpg"></p>
        <p>You may be wondering why the returned hash has "true" and "false" keys. This is because the method called within the block (#include?) asked for a boolean, or a true or false value. A helpful hint: any time you see a method with a '?' at the end of it, it's going to return a boolean!</p>
        <p>As you may be able to guess, the #group_by method can be very useful, depending upon your task. It works beautifully in ordering a list of lists by size, a list of strings by length, or even a list of integers by the remainder when dividing by another integer. To learn more about useful ways to implement the #group_by method, take a look at <a href="http://markusjais.com/the-group_by-method-from-rubys-enumerable-mixin-and-compared-with-scal/">this</a> blog post and also <a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2008/08/31/enumerating-enumerable-enumerablegroup_by/">this</a> one. Happy coding!</p>
