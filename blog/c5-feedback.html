        <p>One of the most interesting aspects of Dev Bootcamp is its emphasis on social coding. I truly love this part of the program because it encourages interaction with people who I know literally nothing about other than they share a similar interest in learning to program. I recall reading the section of the Phase 0 handbook on Pair Programming before DBC began and feeling a tad nervous about the process. The handbook mentioned there may be times when you don't necessarily click with a pairing partner, the roles aren't clearly defined, or even the session feels like a complete disaster. Thus far, I have yet to experience anything of the sort in my pairing sessions. Each partner I have has been extremely kind and open. I have felt the same way about feedback. All of the feedback I have given and received is quite positive, and this isn't a farce.</p>
        <p>That said, I did have an interesting experience reading my feedback from one particular pairing session. I recall that I had written to my pair that our communication wasn't as good as it could have been. I said he/she could work on verbalizing his/her thoughts and emotions more frequently without me having to check-in. When I eventually received some of my feedback, one piece mentioned that I could work on giving the other person the chance to communicate without having to explicitly ask for their thoughts. Naturally, I figured out that this piece of feedback matched the pairing session where I too thought the communication suffered. I found it fascinating that we both picked up on the same thing, but had very different perspectives on it. This, I believe, is the importance in giving and receiving feedback: without reading this piece of feedback, I never would have known that my partner felt stifled by my communication strategies.</p>
