        <p>
          When I first heard about programming bootcamps, I spent several months researching various programs. Several seemed to be more reputable than others and some had "sham" written all over them. After my initial investigation, I narrowed down my search and began looking in-depthly at just a few bootcamps in SF. When I say "in-depth," I mean I went DEEP into the web, reading almost every article and review that had been written about each one. Although I applied to several, DBC was the one that intrigued me the most because of its focus on community, emotional intelligence, and empathy.

          My experience with DBC so far has certainly lived up to the reviews I read online prior to applying. I am a firm believer in engaging thoughtful, curious individuals in the pursuit of knowledge, and I believe DBC attempts to accomplish just that. Having lived in a cooperative living environment for nearly three years during college, I have learned both the ups and downs of a community-based lifestyle. Ultimately, I believe the advantages to such an environment far outweigh the setbacks. I am thrilled to be a part of this journey, but it becomes infinitely more special when I consider that I will be experiencing it alongside twenty-some other incredible individuals.

        <p>
          I would be lying to myself if I said I wasn't nervous about beginning DBC. And to be honest, if I wasn't anxious about the next nineteen (at least) weeks of my life, I don't think I'd be right for the program. Fortunately, I have equal parts fear and excitement, and I think both will be essential in helping me enjoy this journey to its fullest.
