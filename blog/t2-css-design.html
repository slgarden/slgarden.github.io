  <h1>CSS Boxing:</h1>
  <h2>Margin vs. Border vs. Padding</h2>
  <h4>4 January 2015</h4>

      The CSS concepts of margin, border, and padding can be slightly confusing at first. The first two are common in colloquial knowledge: most of us learned about "margins" in grade school when we were instructed to take "margin notes," and we see "borders" everywhere--on an Excel document, a Word table, a photo frame, and so on. However, this third concept--"padding"--can easily throw us for a loop. What exactly is it?

      To differentiate these unfamiliar concepts, I've drawn upon familiar experiences. As mentioned above, margins are fairly well-known as something that exist <em>outside</em> of a given bit of text. Imagine the left- and right-hand margins on a standard sheet of 8 1/2 x 11 ruled paper. We all know these to be outside whatever is written on the page itself. Margins, therefore, can be conceptualized as blank space that is<em>external</em> to content. It can change in size and is often sized by pixels, or "px".

      A border, on the other hand, can be thought of as a frame around some given content. Like a margin, a border can also vary in size. Borders have more flexibility, however, and can be dashed or solid, change color, vary in transparency, and so forth.

      Finally, we have arrived at the most complicated concept. When I hear the word padding, the first thing that comes to mind is "insulation." This is, in fact, a perfect term to help understand the concept of padding. The key emphasis here is <em>in</em>. Whereas margins exist outside of content, padding exists inside the content, between its edge and the inside edge of the border. Similar to a margin, padding is also blank space that can be sized differently according to pixels.
