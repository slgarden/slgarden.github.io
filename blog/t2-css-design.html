          The CSS concepts of margin, border, and padding can be slightly confusing at first. The first two are common in colloquial knowledge: most of us learned about "margins" in grade school when we were instructed to take "margin notes," and we see "borders" everywhere--on an Excel document, a Word table, a photo frame, and so on. However, this third concept--"padding"--can easily throw us for a loop. What exactly is it?
        </p>
        <p>
          To differentiate these unfamiliar concepts, I've drawn upon familiar experiences. As mentioned above, margins are fairly well-known as something that exist <em>outside</em> of a given bit of text. Imagine the left- and right-hand margins on a standard sheet of 8 1/2 x 11 ruled paper. We all know these to be outside whatever is written on the page itself. Margins, therefore, can be conceptualized as blank space that is<em>external</em> to content. It can change in size and is often sized by pixels, or "px".
        </p>
        <p>
          A border, on the other hand, can be thought of as a frame around some given content. Like a margin, a border can also vary in size. Borders have more flexibility, however, and can be dashed or solid, change color, vary in transparency, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we have arrived at the most complicated concept. When I hear the word padding, the first thing that comes to mind is "insulation." This is, in fact, a perfect term to help understand the concept of padding. The key emphasis here is <em>in</em>. Whereas margins exist outside of content, padding exists inside the content, between its edge and the inside edge of the border. Similar to a margin, padding is also blank space that can be sized differently according to pixels.
