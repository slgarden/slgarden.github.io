          My first introduction to the concept of version control was, ironically, not during my first week of Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0. Before beginning the program, I was a senior researcher working fulltime on a data science project at UC Berkeley. The research analyzes a large corpus of text-based data on the fall 2011 Occupy movements to explore the determinants of violence in police and protester interactions. (The data this project will generate can vastly improve the current state of protest policing in the United States, which, if you've been following the news at all over the past few weeks, you'll know needs a LOT of work. Ferguson, anyone?) But I digress! While working on the project, I used git and GitHub to keep track of our team's work and to document the research process. The mere fact that I was introduced to these technologies and concepts months before formally beginning my programming bootcamp demonstrates just how versatile they are--they can be applied to multiple disciplines and you DON'T need to be a professional coder to understand them.

          That being said, let's jump right in. A version control software (such as git) is a program that allows a user to save “snapshots” of their work over time. It enables you to go back to a previous, working version of your work. Developers use version control software to keep track of code they write in case something goes wrong with the program they are creating. In the event that a bug appears in the program, for instance, rather than helplessly searching for where it may be, version control allows developers to return to previous work/ideas rather than having them completely overwritten.

          Git is a version control software that exists locally on an individual computer. It tracks changes on a file or within a directory through series of commits. A commit is a snapshot of a project at particular moment in time. After making some change to a project--be it changing a file or adding a new one--it is necessary to begin tracking new files and stage any changes made to already-tracked files. This is accomplished through the "git add" command. At any point in time, "Git status" may be used to determine what changes have been made or are ready to be made. "Git commit" finalizes those changes by recording them in the history of the project.

           GitHub is a shared social coding website that exists on the Internet. In order for any work completed with git to be seen on GitHub, a user must specify that they want it to appear there by a “git push” command. Otherwise, work completed with git does not automatically sync to GitHub. GitHub is invaluable to version control because it allows multiple people to work on the same document at the same time without overwriting each other’s work. Eventually, when each individual’s changes are ready to be added to the master, or original, copy, they can be “merged” on GitHub.
