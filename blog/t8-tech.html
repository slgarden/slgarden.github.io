        <h1>Ruby on <em>What</em>?</h1>
        <h2>An explanation of "rails"</h2>

        <p>For a while now, I have heard the phrase "Ruby on Rails," but always simply assumed it was the long name for Ruby. That is, I was sadly mistaken in my belief that the two were equivalent, and synonymns for one another. In order to understand the difference between the two, let's first take a look at what <em>exactly</em> Ruby is.</p>
        <p>Ruby is a very powerful object-oriented programming language developed in 1995 by Japanese programmer Yukuhiro Matsumoto. Unlike C++ and Java, Ruby is <em>not</em> a complied language; it is a interpreted or scripted language like JavaScript. This essentially means that it needs an additional program to read through its documents and run the code in the files. This is why you always need to type "ruby" before the .rb filename when you want to run a ruby file in the terminal. Finally, Ruby is Open Source, meaning anyone can use it.</p>
        <p>Ruby <em>on Rails</em>, often shortened to just Rails, is a web application framework for Ruby. It extends the Ruby language by providing more functionality for building websites. Rails uses Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web applications that run on internet servers.</p>
        <p>Rails has certain guilding principles that distinguish it from other frameworks. The first is that it is an "opinionated" framework. This means that there is typically a "right" and "wrong" way to do things in Rails. The "Rails way" is the right way. The second principle is <em>Omakase</em>, which is a Japanese phrase for "I'll leave it to you." This means that Rails has already thought through issues likely to come up in programming and has created its own answers for it. As a programmer using Rails, it is important to get used to leaving some things up to the framework to decide. The third principle is "convention over configuration," which means Rails makes assumptions instead of depending upon extensive configuration files. Again, this is another example of Rails' opinionated software. Finally, Rails uses the D.R.Y--Don't Repeat Yourself--principle in both its code and its development process.</p>
