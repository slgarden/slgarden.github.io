        <p>Life is filled with unknowns, and often the key to unlocking a given puzzle is knowing how to ask the right question (or questions). I must admit, I've been awful with asking questions on the Google+ platform during Phase 0. I am not at all averse to asking for help, so I think this comes down to the fact that I strongly dislike the interface. I find it messy and disorganized, which has dissuaded me from using it to ask my peers anything. On the one hand, this has helped me be a bit more independent and has honed my individual research skills. On the other, it has prevented me from the opportunity to learn how to phrase technical questions in the best possible manner.</p>
        <p>As noted above, one thing I have done a whole lot of during Phase 0 is peruse stackoverflow for existing answers to a similar problem of mine. Amidst reading tons of posts, I have noticed a few key things that make a question "good" and also several qualities that make a question "bad."</p>
        <p>I've found that good questions always begin with an explicit, but not verbose subject title. This is crucial, because chances are people in the future will find their way to your question post looking for answers to a similar problem. If they know immediately from the subject whether the question is related to theirs, it saves a <em>ton</em> of time on their end. Another key aspect of writing a good question is proper formatting, including syntax and indentations. This will help your peers understand what it is you were trying to do, and often makes it easier to find issues with your code. That being said, providing a code sample is also an important qualifier of a good question. Without a tangible solution to work off of, it's difficult for anyone to help you. Even if your question is more theoretical or abstract, providing a concrete example helps others understand exactly where the issue is.</p>
        <p>Bad questions, on the other hand, are often the antithesis of the above. They have poor subject titles, improper formatting, and lack code samples. In addition, a bad question is often one that is simply too long. I find that questions should be written with the same guiding principle that you apply to code: keep it D.R.Y. That is, Don't Repeat Yourself. A question that is too long will likely go unasnwered.</p>
        <p>This is, of course, not an exhaustive list of what goes into making a good question. I still have plenty to learn, so it's a good thing that DBC starts tomorrow!</p>
